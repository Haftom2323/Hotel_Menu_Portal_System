# Hotel_Menu_Portal_System
Hotel customers in Mekelle are unable to know where they can find foods, drinks, and other services that they want or fits their interest. 
They randomly go to hotels around and try to see if what they need is available on the paper menu.  
There is no way to check in which hotel they could find what they want from their home. 
This wastes time, money, difficulty to update the paper menu when new or finished services are available for the hotels and creates dissatisfaction. 
To overcome this problem we came up with an e-hotel in which customers can see a menu of hotels around online and hotels can easily update their menu.
This system reduces time and money wastage. This system works, first customers and hotels register to the system. 
Then hotels can list their services (including menu), can add or delete to or from the existing menu in which registered customers can see. 
To develop this system we used react.js as client-side, express.js as server-side and MySQL as database. 
Generally, the system saves time, money and creates a good interaction between customers and hotels.

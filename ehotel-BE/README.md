This will create a new project and check you out to the new branch. Then make your changes, test it, then add it and push.

#### Check changes: 
`git status`

To add all changed files use `git add .` or <br /> 
`git add file-name` to add a single file
#### Commit your changes
`git commit 'provide here a description about the changes you made'`
#### Push your changes
`git push ` or if the branch name is new use: <br />
`git push --set-upstream origin 'branch-name'`

## Incremental changes.

#### Checkout to master.
`git checkout master`

#### Pull changes made by others
`git pull`

**Then continue creating a new branch and adding your changes**

#### Create a new branch
`git checkout -b 'new-branch-name'`
